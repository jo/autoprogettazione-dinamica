> Dig into the Things

Furniture design shaped by the material and its manufacturing process is design based on possibility, it is material driven design.

We surround ourselves with an increasing number of products with decreasing useful life. Production usually happens far away, hidden. The only touchpoint with the origin of our product is the parcel carrier.

And maybe a website for the ambitious products-nerd and here we are getting closer.

The researched product is in its observation enriched by background information. Maybe about its manufacture, or about special culture of the company, or whatever. In any case, you have spent time with the product, setting up resonance centers, developing topics. And all this resonates when you look at the researched product from now on.

The self-built product has a haptic memory attachment. Its perception is strong and permanently impregnated with an awareness of its fabrication. Maybe you hurt your thumb. It makes you recognize the product in its entire four-dimensionality, interwoven with your personal life.

The self-designed product however lets us experience the world as hackable, as modifiable. The self-designed product invites us to a dialogue with the whole world of products. Active construction and design train us in a critical approach to products.
